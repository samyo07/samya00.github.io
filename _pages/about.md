I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate from <b>Daffodil International University</b> I am passionate about <b>Deep Learning</b> and using my expertise in this field to solve complex real-world problems. <br>

Computer Science has always fascinated me with it's particality and diversity. During my undergraduate studies, I delved into various aspects of the field, particulary focusing on <b>Artificial intelligence</b>. However, my curiosity leading me to explore the captivating domains of <b> Machine Learning , Deep Leanring, and Computer Vision</b>.   

<br>

Throughout my academic journey, I actively participated in programming competitions, sharpening my problem solving skills and nurturing my passion for innovation. Engaging in research projects further fueled my desire to make a meaningful impact. I'm excited to share that I have recently started a new chapter as a Researcher at Health and Informatics Lab. Developing and implementing deep learning algorithms tailored for analyzing medical images to enhance diagnostic accuracy and medical decision-making.
